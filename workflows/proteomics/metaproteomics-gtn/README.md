# MetaProteomics Tutorial
In this metaproteomics worflow, we will identify expressed proteins from a complex bacterial community sample. For this MS/MS data will be matched to peptide sequences provided through a FASTA file.

Metaproteomics is the large-scale characterization of the entire protein complement of environmental microbiota at a given point in time. It has the potential to unravel the mechanistic details of microbial interactions with the host / environment by analyzing the functional dynamics of the microbiome.

More background on this workflow can be found in the [Metaproteomics tutorial](https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material//topics/proteomics/tutorials/metaproteomics/tutorial.html)
